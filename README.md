# Password encryption application
This repository contains source files for an app, which was used as my final high school project (maturita 2016). 

This app uses AES/ECB and PBKDF2 for password encryption, JavaFX for GUI and Native Messaging protocol for accessing passwords from browser (only for Mozilla and Chromium based browsers).

Code shouldn't be used as a reference as it doesn't conform to best practices.
